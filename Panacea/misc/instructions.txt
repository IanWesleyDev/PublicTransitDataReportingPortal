Instructions to generate the service provider metadata needed by SAW

1.  Open the Django shell using: manage.py shell
2.  Run the following command in the new terminal: from Panacea.views_SAML import _get_saml_client
3.  This will print the pysaml2 configuration data in the terminal
4.  In the folder containing these instructions is a config.py file.  Copy the configuration data and replace the
    CONFIG variables assigned value with the new printed data.
5.  I have placed a copy of the pysaml2 make_metadata.py script in the folder containing these instructions.  You will
    use this script to generate the XML metadata required by SAW.
6.  Change directory in your terminal(not Django shell) to this directory. Should be: cd .\panacea\misc
7.  Run the make_metada.py script using this command: make_metadata.py Config.py > metadata.xml
8.  The metadata.xml file in this folder will contain the XML metadata required by SAW.
