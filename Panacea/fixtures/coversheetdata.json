Prior to that, the ferry crossed a free-flowing Columbia River rather than the slack water of Franklin D. Roosevelt Lake it crosses today. The Motor Vessel Sanpoil, also known as the Keller Ferry, is 116 feet in length with a 45-foot beam. The capacity of the vessel is 20 cars with a maximum of 149 passengers and two crew members. During normal lake elevation operations, the ferry runs on-demand in order to avoid unnecessary empty runs. The ferry crew can observe both landings and remain at the north or south landing until a vehicle appears needing to cross in either direction. Approximately 50,000 vehicles travel on the Keller Ferry each year. Walk-on passengers are few as the ferry route is a link in a rural highway, State Route 21. The nearest communities are Wilbur, 14 miles to the south, and Republic, 53 miles north. The free ferry operates seven days a week, 18 hours a day, from 6:00 a.m. until midnight.
